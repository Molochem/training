# Mastering Plone 6 Development MyST

_Mastering Plone Development_ is intended as a training to learn proven practices of Plone development. It's both, an online course and a sketch for an on-the-spot training.

The story of a conference platform provides a week-long training of several development topics that can be split in two trainings:

- A beginner training (2 to 3 days) covering the essentials of Plone and Plone Volto.
- An advanced training (3 to 5 days) with additional advanced topics.

:::{note}
This is the _Mastering Plone 6 Development Training_.

_Mastering Plone 6 Development Training_ supplements [Mastering Plone 5](https://training.plone.org/5/mastering-plone-5/) with known best practices for customizing and developing Plone 6: Plone Classic + frontend.

In chapters handling Volto React frontend is a link to a chapter that covers the corresponding tasks in Plone Classic, and vice versa.

Plone 6 is not yet released and thus the training is a work in-progress and there are still some rough edges.
